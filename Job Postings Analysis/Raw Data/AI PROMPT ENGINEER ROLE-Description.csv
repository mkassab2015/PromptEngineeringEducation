We're talking about setting up AI agents that can handle entire sales processes, research competitors while you're having coffee, or manage social media campaigns without human babysitting. You'll be working with the latest LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini - whatever works best) and figuring out the perfect prompts to make them do exactly what we need.


The Agent Army You'll Create
Outbound Sales Agents: These bad boys qualify leads, send personalized emails, and follow up like clockwork
Voice Agents: AI that can actually have phone conversations without sounding like a robot from 1995
Research Agents: Digital detectives that dig up market insights, competitor intel, and industry trends
SEO Agents: Content optimization machines that boost search rankings while you sleep
Social Media Agents: Creative AI that posts, engages, and grows social media presence automatically


Client Magic


You'll work directly with business owners who have problems they need solved. Think of yourself as an AI translator - they tell you their pain points, you figure out how to automate the solution. Sometimes you'll need to build quick prototypes to show them what's possible, other times you'll be deep in technical documentation (but we promise to keep that fun).


Technical Wizardry


Most of your day will be in n8n building complex workflows that actually work in the real world. You'll be connecting APIs, handling data flows, setting up error handling that doesn't break at 3 AM, and making sure everything runs smoothly. When things inevitably break (because AI), you'll be the one figuring out why and fixing it.


You Should Apply If You Have


The Core Skills We Actually Need


Prompt Engineering Ninja: You know how to talk to AI models like GPT-4 and Claude to get them to do exactly what you want, not just give generic responses
n8n Master: You can build complex workflows that don't break when someone sneezes. Bonus points if you've built custom nodes or done weird integrations
AI Whisperer: You understand how LLMs work, their quirks, and how to work around their limitations without pulling your hair out
API Juggler: REST APIs, webhooks, and third-party integrations don't scare you. If it has an API, you can probably connect it to something
Code Comfortable: JavaScript or Python skills - you don't need to be a coding rockstar, but you should be able to automate stuff and debug when things go wrong
AI Platform Experience


You've actually used these tools in real projects, not just watched YouTube tutorials:
OpenAI models, Claude, Gemini, or other LLMs for actual work
AI development platforms and know which ones are worth using
Vector databases and RAG implementations (even if you just call it ""making AI remember stuff"")
Maybe some experience making AI models better through fine-tuning


The Soft Skills That Matter


You can explain complex AI stuff to people who think ChatGPT is magic
You don't mind jumping on calls with clients and actually enjoy solving their problems
You can manage multiple projects without everything falling apart
You understand how businesses actually work (sales, marketing, operations - the unsexy stuff that makes money)


Bonus Points If You Have


Extra Technical Superpowers


Web scraping and data extraction skills - turning the internet into your research assistant
CRM integrations (HubSpot, Salesforce) - because every business lives in their CRM
Social media APIs and automation - making brands look active without the manual work
Cloud platform experience - AWS, Google Cloud, wherever the servers live
Experience with voice AI (ElevenLabs, Azure Speech) - making AI that actually sounds human


Real-World Experience
Background in digital marketing, sales, or business automation (you've seen the problems firsthand)
Experience with SaaS companies or agencies (you know the hustle)
SEO knowledge with tools like SEMrush or Ahrefs (you understand the content game)
Understanding of how social media marketing actually works (not just posting random stuff)




Why You'll Love Working Here


Fully Remote: Work from anywhere with good internet. Your home office, a coffee shop, or that cabin in the woods - we don't care as long as you're productive
Flexible Hours: Night owl? Early bird? Work when you're most effective. We care about results, not when you clock in
Cutting-Edge Tech: You'll get to play with the latest AI tools and actually use them to solve real problems (not just demos)


How to Apply


Send us:
Your resume (keep it real, skip the corporate buzzwords)
Portfolio of AI stuff you've built - n8n workflows, agent examples, whatever shows your skills
A quick note about the coolest AI solution you've created and why you loved building it
Any examples of prompt engineering magic or agent development (GitHub links, videos, whatever works)
We're more interested in what you can build than where you went to school or worked before. Show us your AI superpowers and let's chat about making some digital magic together.",Prompt Engineer / Artificial Intelligence Consultant,Easy Outsource,11–50 employees,Outsourcing and Offshoring Consulting,Singapore

At PriceShape, we see AI as a natural next step in how we improve the way we work and build products. We're not chasing hype - we're focused on using the right tools to create real, lasting value. That’s why we’re looking for an ambitious AI Workflow & Prompt Engineer to help us explore new ways of working, optimize what we already do well, and bring AI into both our internal processes and customer-facing solutions.

This role is ideal for someone who’s deeply passionate about AI and optimization. Whether your strengths lie in designing AI-driven internal processes, building prompt frameworks for AI agents, or turning theoretical concepts into working prototypes - we want to hear from you!

What You’ll Be Doing

Depending on your background and interests, your focus could include:

 Internal Workflow Optimization 

Explore and improve how we work across the company using LLMs, automation tools, and AI agents
Collaborate across teams to uncover everyday challenges and explore AI-driven solutions
Design and prototype AI-assisted workflows that make us faster, smarter, and more efficient

AI-Powered Customer Experience

Contribute to our ongoing project of building a customer-facing AI agent within our platform
Design prompts, structure knowledge, and improve accuracy and relevance of AI outputs
Work closely with Development, Support and Customer Success to shape the agent’s capabilities and behavior

Who You Are

We’re not looking for a specific title - we’re looking for someone who’s passionate about optimizing workflows and creating value using AI.

We’re open to candidates from diverse professional backgrounds - but most likely, you have experience as a Data Scientist or Software Developer, and you’ve already started exploring or working with AI prompt engineering.

Regardless of your path, here’s what we’re really looking for:

You have hands-on experience working with leading LLM providers (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, or Perplexity) - not just as a user, but as someone who builds with them
You’re motivated by practical impact: turning ideas into working solutions, whether internally or as part of a product
You enjoy figuring out how things work - and how they can work better with AI in the loop
You’re comfortable navigating ambiguity and are eager to experiment, test, and iterate
If you can implement your own workflows or prototypes, that’s a big plus - but it’s not a hard requirement

If you’re curious, ambitious, and driven by using AI to make things actually better - then we’d love to talk.

Why join PriceShape?

Be part of a growing SaaS company using AI where it truly adds value
Work on both internal workflow optimization and external product innovation
Join a curious and ambitious team that values progress over perfection
Enjoy an informal, friendly, and international culture with room for personal growth and work-life balance
Flexible hours, great lunch and fun social events - all in the heart of Aarhus

About PriceShape

Today, we serve customers in 25+ countries and have big ambitions to become the global category leader.

We prioritize work-life balance, trust, community and focus on personal and professional growth. We offer flexible hours, social events, pension and health insurance, great work facilities and an in-house canteen.

"About the job

Translation:
We’re building a chatbot that searches an SQL database: The user sends a question through the MCP Host. This is forwarded as a prompt to a (test-time scaling) LLM chain. After reasoning, the LLM chain generates the SQL query, which is passed to a Tool Agent that executes the query. The resulting JSON is sent to the Chat Agent, which responds in the chat interface.
