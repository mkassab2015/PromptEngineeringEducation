"About the job
Prompt Engineer / AI Specialist (Remote)


About Us


We're a company that's obsessed with making AI actually useful for businesses. Instead of flashy demos that don't work in the real world, we build AI solutions that genuinely solve problems and make people's lives easier. Think automated sales agents that actually convert, voice bots that don't sound like robots, and research tools that save hours of manual work.


The Role


We're looking for someone who gets excited about turning ""what if we could automate this?"" ideas into reality. You'll be the person who figures out how to make LLMs do the heavy lifting for businesses - whether that's building outbound sales machines, creating AI assistants that handle customer calls, or developing research bots that dig up insights while people sleep.




This is 100% remote work with flexible hours. As long as you're delivering great results and available for client calls when needed, we don't care if you're most productive at 6 AM or 11 PM.




What You'll Actually Be Doing




Building Cool AI Stuff




You'll spend most of your time in n8n creating workflows that make businesses run themselves. We're talking about setting up AI agents that can handle entire sales processes, research competitors while you're having coffee, or manage social media campaigns without human babysitting. You'll be working with the latest LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini - whatever works best) and figuring out the perfect prompts to make them do exactly what we need.


The Agent Army You'll Create
Outbound Sales Agents: These bad boys qualify leads, send personalized emails, and follow up like clockwork
Voice Agents: AI that can actually have phone conversations without sounding like a robot from 1995
Research Agents: Digital detectives that dig up market insights, competitor intel, and industry trends
SEO Agents: Content optimization machines that boost search rankings while you sleep
Social Media Agents: Creative AI that posts, engages, and grows social media presence automatically


Client Magic


You'll work directly with business owners who have problems they need solved. Think of yourself as an AI translator - they tell you their pain points, you figure out how to automate the solution. Sometimes you'll need to build quick prototypes to show them what's possible, other times you'll be deep in technical documentation (but we promise to keep that fun).


Technical Wizardry


Most of your day will be in n8n building complex workflows that actually work in the real world. You'll be connecting APIs, handling data flows, setting up error handling that doesn't break at 3 AM, and making sure everything runs smoothly. When things inevitably break (because AI), you'll be the one figuring out why and fixing it.


You Should Apply If You Have


The Core Skills We Actually Need


Prompt Engineering Ninja: You know how to talk to AI models like GPT-4 and Claude to get them to do exactly what you want, not just give generic responses
n8n Master: You can build complex workflows that don't break when someone sneezes. Bonus points if you've built custom nodes or done weird integrations
AI Whisperer: You understand how LLMs work, their quirks, and how to work around their limitations without pulling your hair out
API Juggler: REST APIs, webhooks, and third-party integrations don't scare you. If it has an API, you can probably connect it to something
Code Comfortable: JavaScript or Python skills - you don't need to be a coding rockstar, but you should be able to automate stuff and debug when things go wrong
AI Platform Experience


You've actually used these tools in real projects, not just watched YouTube tutorials:
OpenAI models, Claude, Gemini, or other LLMs for actual work
AI development platforms and know which ones are worth using
Vector databases and RAG implementations (even if you just call it ""making AI remember stuff"")
Maybe some experience making AI models better through fine-tuning


The Soft Skills That Matter


You can explain complex AI stuff to people who think ChatGPT is magic
You don't mind jumping on calls with clients and actually enjoy solving their problems
You can manage multiple projects without everything falling apart
You understand how businesses actually work (sales, marketing, operations - the unsexy stuff that makes money)


Bonus Points If You Have


Extra Technical Superpowers


Web scraping and data extraction skills - turning the internet into your research assistant
CRM integrations (HubSpot, Salesforce) - because every business lives in their CRM
Social media APIs and automation - making brands look active without the manual work
Cloud platform experience - AWS, Google Cloud, wherever the servers live
Experience with voice AI (ElevenLabs, Azure Speech) - making AI that actually sounds human


Real-World Experience
Background in digital marketing, sales, or business automation (you've seen the problems firsthand)
Experience with SaaS companies or agencies (you know the hustle)
SEO knowledge with tools like SEMrush or Ahrefs (you understand the content game)
Understanding of how social media marketing actually works (not just posting random stuff)




Why You'll Love Working Here


Fully Remote: Work from anywhere with good internet. Your home office, a coffee shop, or that cabin in the woods - we don't care as long as you're productive
Flexible Hours: Night owl? Early bird? Work when you're most effective. We care about results, not when you clock in
Cutting-Edge Tech: You'll get to play with the latest AI tools and actually use them to solve real problems (not just demos)


How to Apply


Send us:
Your resume (keep it real, skip the corporate buzzwords)
Portfolio of AI stuff you've built - n8n workflows, agent examples, whatever shows your skills
A quick note about the coolest AI solution you've created and why you loved building it

Work on both internal workflow optimization and external product innovation
Join a curious and ambitious team that values progress over perfection
Enjoy an informal, friendly, and international culture with room for personal growth and work-life balance
